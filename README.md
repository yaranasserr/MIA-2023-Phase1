# Linux Commands 

This README provides simple descriptions of common Linux commands.

## `cd` - Change Directory

The `cd` command is used to navigate between different directories (folders) in the Linux file system. It allows you to move to a different directory by specifying the directory path as an argument.

Usage:
```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

## `ls` - List

The `ls` command is used to list the files and directories in the current directory. When used without any arguments, it displays the contents of the current directory.

Usage:
```bash
ls
```

## `touch`

The `touch` command is used to create an empty file with the specified name. If the file already exists, it updates the timestamp of the file. It's commonly used to create new, empty text files.

Usage:
```bash
touch filename.txt
```

## `cat` - Concatenate

The `cat` command is used to display the contents of a file on the terminal. It allows you to view the contents of a text file without opening it in a text editor.

Usage:
```bash
cat filename.txt
```

## `nano`

`Nano` is a simple text editor for the terminal. It allows you to create and edit text files directly from the command line. It's user-friendly and provides basic editing features.

Usage:
```bash
nano filename.txt
```

## `python3 file.py`

This command is used to execute a Python script named "file.py" using Python 3. It runs the Python script and performs the actions defined in the script. You need to have Python 3 installed to use this command.

Usage:
```bash
python3 file.py
```

These commands are fundamental for navigating and working with files and directories in a Linux-based operating system.
