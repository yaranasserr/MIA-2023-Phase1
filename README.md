# MIA-2023-Phase1
# Project Tasks Overview

This repository contains the code and materials related to different tasks I've worked on. Each task focuses on a specific topic and involves different programming languages and concepts.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Programming in C

In this task, I explored programming in C. I practiced writing C programs to understand core concepts such as variables, control structures, functions, and memory management.

### Task 2: Circuits and Hardware

For this task, I delved into circuits and hardware design. I learned about electronic components, circuit diagrams, and basic hardware interactions.

### Task 3: Arduino and Embedded Systems

Task 3 involved working with Arduino and embedded systems. I gained hands-on experience in programming microcontrollers, interfacing sensors and actuators, and building simple embedded projects.

### Task 4: OOP in Python, Machine Learning, and Linear Regression

In this task, I expanded my programming skills to Python, focusing on object-oriented programming. Additionally, I delved into machine learning and implemented a linear regression model, demonstrating my understanding of data analysis and predictive modeling.
