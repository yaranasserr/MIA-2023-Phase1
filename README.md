#  Task 6.2 :Motor Encoder Calculation
## Introduction:
Rotary encoders are devices used to measure the angular position or rotation of a shaft. They generate electrical signals that can be used to count the number of rotations and the direction of rotation.

## Components:
- Rotary Encoder: The main component with contact zones A and B.
- A and B Signals: The two square wave signals generated by the encoder as it rotates.
- Common Pin: The central pin that is used as a reference point.

## Principle of Operation:
- When the rotary encoder rotates, contact zones A and B make or break contact with the common pin.
- As the encoder rotates, it generates square wave signals on pins A and B.
- The two signals are 90 degrees out of phase.
- If the encoder is rotating clockwise, the output on pin A will lead the output on pin B, and vice versa.

## Counting Rotations:
To count the number of rotations using a rotary encoder, follow these steps:
1. Connect pins A and B to your microcontroller or counting device.
2. Monitor the square wave signals on pins A and B.
3. Count the pulses of these signals.
4. Observe the phase relationship between the signals to determine the direction of rotation:
   - If A leads B, it's clockwise rotation.
   - If B leads A, it's counterclockwise rotation.

## Parameters

- Pulse per rotation (PPR) = 540
- Wheel radius (R) = 0.2 meters
- Max speed (V) = 0.5 meters per second

## Calculation

To calculate the rotation per second (RPS) and pulse per second (PPS), we'll use the following equations:

1. Calculate the rotation per second (RPS):RPS = Max Speed / (2 * π * Wheel Radius)
RPS = 0.5 m/s / (2 * π * 0.2 m)
RPS ≈ 0.3979 rotations per second

2. Calculate the pulse per second (PPS):

PPS = 0.3979 RPS * 540 PPR
PPS ≈ 214.626 pulses per second
## Results

For a motor encoder with the specified parameters:

- Rotation per second (RPS) ≈ 0.3979 rotations per second
- Pulse per second (PPS) ≈ 214.626 pulses per second

Assume that the Pulse per second= cutoff frequency 
## CutOff Frequency = 214.626 Hz
