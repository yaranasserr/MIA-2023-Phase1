## MPU6050 Yaw Angle Calculation

### Purpose

The purpose of this Arduino code is to interface with the MPU6050 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor and calculate the yaw angle. The yaw angle represents the rotation around the z-axis.

### Components

- Arduino board
- MPU6050 sensor


### Key Functions and Logic

#### Initialization

- The code initializes I2C communication 
- It configures the MPU6050 by setting the power management, accelerometer configuration, and gyroscope configuration registers.

#### Main Loop

- In the main loop, the code reads raw Z-axis gyroscope data from the MPU6050 register.
- It converts the gyroscope data into angular velocity using the specified sensitivity factor (131 LSB/(degrees/s)).
- The calculated angular velocity represents the yaw rate.
- The yaw angle is printed to the serial monitor, allowing you to observe the sensor's output.
